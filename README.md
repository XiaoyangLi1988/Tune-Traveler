# Tune-Traveler
A musical implementation of the A* path-finding algorithm.
Project is as detailed in the FP4-Proposal repository.

## TODO
* Add animation to update for moving the player from point A to B along the given path.
* Add sound to tiles so that sounds are played as player traverses the grid.
* Implement A* path-finding algorithm so that program finds shortest path from A to B.
* Create preset grid layouts for testing and demonstration.
* Add more interesting graphical effects. (Stretch Goal)
